# Overview

We're looking to create a simple web-app. The design is fully scoped and we are looking now for an experienced full-stack developer to create the tool. 
Most of our code is written in python so for ease of maintenance we'd like this to be too. The application deals with sensitive data, the implementation will need robust access control. Docker and LDAP integration will be required. The data should be stored in Oracle.

# Working Here

AHL has a small company, no-attitude feel. It is flat structured, open, transparent and collaborative. We are actively engaged with the broader technology community through meetups & open source.
Weâ€™re fortunate enough to have a fantastic open-plan office overlooking the River Thames, and continually strive to make our environment a great place in which to work. 

As a contractor here you'll be the sole developer working on the app but will be expected to attend brief daily stand-ups to track progress, and to take on feedback through peer-reviewed pull requests.

# Skills / Experience

# Essential

* Expert in Python with knowledge of Flask / Pyramid
* Good understanding of front-end technologies such as JavaScript - Angular / React & Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3
